TO DO
-sound effects (each different tile has a different note from the major scale?)
-crt shader? just need to enable and configure
-lives system and UI
- little bug: ball can move the paddle with a certain squishing against the walls
  when it comes time to reset the paddle and ball position after a life is lost,
  add a little check constantly during play that the paddle's y pos is the same as its start y pos

fulfill basic requirements from challenge page

different coloured tiles with different amounts of hits to break
other different types of tiles - score mult, other effects ...

-> increase speed of ball
-> score mult
-> paddle speed? 

is it a pick from three perks game or a deckbuilder? choose which tiles are going to go into the set of tiles the board is constructed from?
reshuffle system like in nubby after goal is passed and ball goes off the edge?
reset ball speed every new round

desperately want roguelike elements - set number of lives, powerups, control which direciton the initial ball launch goes, change certain properties of the board, score requirements per round ... 


CURRENT BRICK SPAWNING SETUP
if a brick is going to spawn a new brick after it gets hit this is done with the spawnBrickSignal signal
when we instance a new brick, this signal is connected with code
but if we make the scene from hand to start with, this connection is not made and has to be done manually first
the new instances of that type of brick will have the signal connected automatically, though

this is the case for all signals associated with bricks:
	- score signal
	- spawning signal
	- score popup signal
